/**
 * worktree-session-owner-guard.mjs - PreToolUse Edit|Write|MultiEdit|Bash Hook
 *
 * In multi-session environments, enforces that an AI session **only edits and commits files
 * within worktrees created by its own session**. If the `.session-owner` sidecar of the worktree
 * where target file/commit belongs mismatches current session (`data.session_id`), denies execution.
 *
 * Policy SSOT: internal-rule (worktree-session-ownership.md).
 * Sidecar recording: worktree-owner-tracker.mjs (PostToolUse Bash).
 *
 * 2-Layer Defense :
 *   Layer 1 — cwd-confinement (deterministic, orphan-proof, session_id agnostic, PRIMARY):
 *     Target worktree ≠ cwd worktree → deny. No sidecar required → no orphan loopholes.
 *     cwd is main repo (outside worktree) while target is worktree → deny.
 *   Layer 2 — ownership **lease** (SECONDARY, defends against another *live* session in the same worktree):
 *     `.session-owner` holds a different session id **and the lease is still fresh** → deny.
 *     An expired lease is adopted here (`claimOwnerLease`) and the edit proceeds.
 *
 * Why Layer 2 is a lease:
 *   The old Layer 2 denied whenever the owner differed and advised "delegate to the session that
 *   created this worktree". Once that session was gone there was nobody to delegate to, and the only
 *   way out was hand-editing the sidecar — the worktree stayed blocked forever. With a lease a live
 *   session is still blocked, and an abandoned worktree frees itself after the TTL.
 *   TTL and renewal rules SSOT: `.cli/lib/worktree-owner-lease.mjs`.
 *
 *   Deleting Layer 2 would be a smaller change, but it would leave the **default setup unguarded**:
 *   Layer 1 only denies when `cwdWt !== null`, so it decides nothing for a session whose cwd is the
 *   main clone root (the usual starting point). In that setup Layer 2 is the only thing standing
 *   between a session and another session's worktree.
 *
 * Behavior:
 *   - tool is not Edit|Write|MultiEdit|Bash → passthrough
 *   - target not under .worktrees/ (main repo file) → passthrough (worktree-policy-guard domain)
 *   - `.tmp/create-pr-active` exists → passthrough (ship/create-pr carve-out)
 *   - Bash is not `git commit` / is `--dry-run` → passthrough (default `session_owner_scope: "commit"`)
 *   - opt-in `session_owner_scope: "all_bash"` (worktree-policy.json): every Bash command is checked
 *     against every worktree it touches (see `bashTargets`):
 *       · where it runs — cwd, each `cd`, cumulative `git -C` / `make -C` → Layer 1 + Layer 2
 *       · path arguments and redirect targets resolving into a worktree (`../other/src`,
 *         `--manifest-path`, absolute paths) → Layer 2 only (a live foreign lease denies; reading
 *         another worktree from your own is not a Layer 1 violation)
 *       · the `git commit` target → exactly as in the `commit` scope
 *     all_bash never claims, renews or adopts a lease for non-commit commands — only the commit /
 *     edit paths (and worktree-owner-tracker) do, so `ls .worktrees/other` from trunk cannot take
 *     over a worktree. A command the scanner cannot parse is denied (fail closed when opted in).
 *   - Bash "where it runs" starts from `commandCwd` when the adapter provides it (Antigravity
 *     `toolCall.args.Cwd`), else `cwd` — shared `withCommandCwd` (lib/utils.mjs)
 *   - Layer 1: cwd worktree ≠ target worktree → **deny**
 *   - Layer 2: same worktree, foreign owner, **fresh lease** → **deny**; expired → adopt + passthrough
 *   - error → passthrough (internal-rule fail-open)
