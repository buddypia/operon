/**
 * worktree-owner-tracker.mjs — PostToolUse Bash Hook (CLI-agnostic)
 *
 * Writes worktree mailbox sidecars after successful git events. Two responsibilities, one execution path:
 *
 *   1. Ownership — immediately after successful worktree creation commands (`make wt.new` /
 *      `worktree-new.mjs` / `git worktree add`), records current session ID into
 *      `.tmp/worktree-<safeBranch>/.session-owner`. Tracks owning sessions per worktree (1 sidecar per worktree).
 *      The write goes through `claimOwnerLease`, so re-running `make wt.new` on a branch another
 *      session is actively holding does **not** take it over — `worktree-new.mjs` exits 0 on an
 *      idempotent skip, and an unconditional write there silently stole live leases.
 *      TTL SSOT: `.cli/lib/worktree-owner-lease.mjs`. Policy SSOT: internal-rule (worktree-session-ownership.md).
 *
 *   2. Lease heartbeat — on **every** successful Bash call, refreshes the lease of the worktree the
 *      command acted on (`commitDir`: `git -C <path>` first, then the session cwd) **only if this
 *      session already holds it** (`renewOwnerLease`). Without this the only renewal points were edits
 *      and commits, so a live session doing builds, gates, deploys or waiting on human review went
 *      silent past the TTL and lost its own worktree. It never adopts: this hook has no Layer 1 cwd
 *      check, so a read-only `git -C <other-worktree> log` adopting an expired lease would lock the
 *      real owner out for a full TTL. Adoption belongs to the edit/commit guard.
 *
 *   3. Regression-test lock announcement — immediately after a successful `git commit` on a `fix/*` /
 *      `hotfix/*` branch, tells the agent (one context line) which test files that commit **added** and that
 *      they are now locked. The lock itself is **git history** (`.cli/lib/test-lock.mjs#derivedLockedFiles`):
 *      this hook writes nothing, so there is no state to forge or forget (adversarial review 2026-09-07 —
 *      the earlier ledger write was replaced because a file the agent can edit is not a lock).
 *      `commit-guard` denies commits touching those files until `regression-test-lock.mjs unlock <file> --reason`
 *      records a release. Edits are denied only where `coverage-threshold-guard` is installed and wired — the
 *      notice asks `test-lock.mjs#isEditLockEnforced` and says so either way, because a notice promising a
 *      block that does not exist is worse than none. Attached here because this hook
 *      already sits on PostToolUse Bash and `harness-budget#hook_files` is frozen at 65.
 *      Scope: `fix/*` / `hotfix/*` only — feature branches edit tests continuously and would only collect
 *      friction. Added (`A`) files only — a modified test in a fix commit is the fix author's judgement call.
 *      Policy SSOT: internal-rule (testing.md).
 *
 * Why: For worktree-session-owner-guard to allow edits/commits only for "worktrees created by my session",
 * the owning session must be recorded at creation time. Since session_id is provided via hook stdin JSON
 * rather than env vars, only a PostToolUse hook can record this.
 *
 * Multi-CLI: `session_id` is present in Claude Code and Codex payloads.
 * `run(data)` is exported and delegated to by `.cli/_cli-dispatch.mjs`.
 *
 * Behavior: Non-worktree-creation / missing session_id / unparseable branch / failed command / worktree not found
 *       → no-op. The tracker never blocks tool invocations.
