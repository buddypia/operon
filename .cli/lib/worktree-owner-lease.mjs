/**
 * worktree-owner-lease.mjs — SSOT for treating the worktree ownership sidecar as an **expiring lease**.
 *
 * Two words used in this file:
 *   lease     — like a library loan card. It marks who is using a worktree, and it has a due date.
 *               Before the due date nobody else may use it; after it, the next session takes it over.
 *   heartbeat — the signal that the holder is still working. Every edit, commit, or Bash call in the
 *               worktree pushes the due date out. When the holder walks away the signal stops and the
 *               lease runs out.
 *
 * Why a lease:
 *   `worktree-session-owner-guard` Layer 2 used to deny whenever the owner id differed, advising
 *   "delegate to the session that created this worktree". When that session no longer existed there
 *   was nobody to delegate to, and the harness had **no takeover procedure** — the only way out was
 *   hand-editing line 1 of the sidecar.
 *
 *   The sidecar mtime could not serve as a liveness signal either: `worktree-owner-tracker` wrote the
 *   sidecar only on worktree **creation** commands, so the mtime was frozen at creation time.
 *
 *   So the sidecar becomes a lease with a heartbeat. `claimOwnerLease` rewrites the file (bumping its
 *   mtime) whenever the owning session touches the worktree. While the lease is fresh, foreign edits
 *   are still denied; once it expires, the next session adopts it automatically. No new command and
 *   no new doc — a design that relies on a human remembering a takeover procedure is what failed.
 *
 * Who may do what (two entry points, deliberately different):
 *   1. `claimOwnerLease` — renew **or adopt**. Called only where a session commits to working in the
 *      worktree: `worktree-session-owner-guard` (the **target** worktree of Edit/Write/MultiEdit/
 *      apply_patch and `git commit`) and the tracker's worktree-creation path.
 *   2. `renewOwnerLease` — renew **only a lease this session already holds**. Called by
 *      `worktree-owner-tracker` on every successful Bash call whose `commitDir` (`git -C <path>`
 *      first, then the session cwd) is inside a worktree. A read-only `git -C <other-worktree> log`
 *      must never adopt someone else's expired lease: the tracker has no Layer 1 cwd check, so an
 *      adopting heartbeat let a passing reader lock the real owner out for a full TTL.
 *   Without the Bash heartbeat, a live owner doing builds, gates, deploys, or waiting on human review
 *   for longer than the TTL lost its own worktree (reproduced by an adversarial review).
 *
 *   Remaining gaps:
 *   - A session whose cwd is the main clone root and that works for longer than the TTL using only
 *     Bash without `git -C`. The moment it uses an edit tool, (1) renews the lease.
 *   - Antigravity has **no Bash heartbeat**: its PostToolUse payload carries no `toolCall`, so the
 *     tracker cannot see the command or its directory (`.cli/docs/MULTI-CLI.md`, PostToolUse
 *     limitation). There, only edits and commits (PreToolUse guard) refresh the lease.
 *
 * Never creates a worktree: writes are skipped when the worktree root does not exist, so a heartbeat
 *   or claim racing `git worktree remove` cannot resurrect `.worktrees/<branch>/.tmp/...` and make a
 *   later `git worktree add` at that path fail. Only the `.tmp/worktree-<key>/` mailbox under an
 *   existing worktree is created.
 *
 * Mailbox key: every caller passes `branch = null`, so the sidecar path is always derived from the
 *   worktree path (`inferBranchFromWorktreePath`). Passing the real branch on one side only splits
 *   the sidecar in two for branches with more than two segments (`feature/a/b`).
 *
 * File format (only line 1 is the contract):
 *   line 1  : owning session id
 *   line 2+ : `#`-prefixed takeover audit lines (newest last, at most MAX_AUDIT_LINES)
 *   Readers have always read line 1 only, so the old single-line format stays valid as-is and the
 *   appended audit lines do not break older readers.
 *
 * Boundary: every error here is swallowed . An unreadable lease reads as "no
 *   owner"; an unwritable one is retried on the next event. A full disk or a permission problem must
 *   never make the guard stop human work.

 * Why 2 hours: an active agent session edits, commits, and runs commands many times an hour, so two
 * idle hours effectively means "walked away from this worktree". Longer would stretch the original
 * failure (blocked by a dead owner) by the same amount. The cost of erring short is limited to a
