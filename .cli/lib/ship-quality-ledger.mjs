/**
 * ship-quality-ledger.mjs — Ship-time quality label cumulative ledger + consecutive cross-review skip detection
 *
 * Root problem (empirical): internal-rule requires both `/code-review --fix` + `code-reviewer` agent
 *   for substantial changes, allowing `pre-quality-gate` fallback + label downgrade (`agent_go` → `self_review_pass`)
 *   when agents cannot be used. However, that downgrade is recorded **only within that PR**.
 *   Nowhere could answer "how many consecutive PRs were merged without secondary review".
 *
 *   The risk is not hypothetical — in PR #1050, code-reviewer caught 1 HIGH finding (missing rename),
 *   and in PR #1057, it caught 1 HIGH finding (false clean on registry failure). Both were missed by self-review.
 *   Conversely, #1054 and #1056 were merged with downgraded labels, their continuity invisible until human audit
 *   (same structure as discovering DEBT-248 after "3 consecutive" misses).
 *
 * Solution: Append one line (jsonl) for every **successfully merged** ship + expose streak counts as warnings.
 *   Merge gating is caller's responsibility — `ops.mjs#shouldRecordShipQuality` (does not record on `--no-merge`
 *   or pending CI; recording on retries would inflate streak counts).
 *   Non-blocking — label downgrade is an explicitly permitted path in internal-rule and falls under user sovereignty .
 *   The value of this mechanism is not *blocking*, but **making the normalization of deviance visible**.
 *
 * Trunk reconciliation: the ledger is written only by `ops.mjs` on its own
 *   successful merge, so it describes the compliant path and nothing else — five consecutive merges that
 *   bypassed ops.mjs left no row and the streak counter never saw them. Git is therefore the source of
 *   truth for *what landed* (`git log --first-parent origin/<base>`) and the ledger supplies only the
 *   label: `reconcileWithTrunk` joins landings to rows by `merge_sha` (legacy rows fall back to the PR
 *   number), and a landing with no row counts as `unrecorded`.
 *
 * Storage location: `.harness/system/ship-quality-ledger.jsonl` (system_persistent — shared across worktrees.
 *   internal-rule / internal-rule cross-ref. Via `resolveSystemFile` + atomic append).
 *
 * Boundary : Perspective 1 only — internal-rule itself is never_deploy. Scaffold targets have their own review
 *   stack (`final-review`) and single-project scope where "consecutive PRs" carries a different meaning.
