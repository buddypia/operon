/**
 * quality-gate-labels.mjs — Single SSOT for Quality Gate label enum + per-label PROOF evidence contracts
 *
 * Enum for marker JSON `quality_gate` field representing internal-rule (Pre-Ship Quality Gate)
 * environment branching + self-check fallback. Imported by both mark-pre-ship-confirmed.mjs (CLI emitter)
 * and pre-ship-review-guard.mjs (hook verifier).
 *
 * Label meanings:
 * - `agent_go`         : Both `/code-review --fix` + `code-reviewer` **agent** evaluated as Go (highest path).
 *                        Single entry point via `/code-review` after `/simplify` removal and `simplifit` skill deprecation on 2026-05-27  retired-ref-ok: simplifit deprecation records historical context — not an invocation instruction
 * - `skill_review_pass`: Agent not used. Independent 2nd review performed via a review **skill** + Go.
 *                        What to run is `REPO_REVIEW_ASSETS` (repo-shipped); what *counts* once run is
 *                        `LABEL_EVIDENCE_MARKERS` (wider — includes `/code-review` for environments that have it).
 * - `self_review_pass` : Pure self-review where 2nd review tools could not be run (Panel Decisions reason specified)
 * - `trivial_skip`     : internal-rule trivial exemption (≤2 files + ≤20 LOC + non-substantive)
 *
 * Rationale for creating `skill_review_pass` (empirical): Previous vocabulary recognized "cross-reviewed"
 *   only when agents were used (`ship-quality-ledger.mjs#CROSS_REVIEWED_LABELS = {agent_go}`).
 *   However, hooks cannot invoke subagents (prompt-type hooks are *instruction injections*, and prompt-type SubagentStop
 *   is prohibited by internal-rule to avoid output pollution), and some sessions lack Agent invocation permissions.
 *   When such sessions ran proper 2nd reviews via skills, labels were downgraded to `self_review_pass`, recording the **same
 *   value** in ledgers as doing nothing — measuring tool types rather than whether 2nd reviews were performed.
 *   Empirical: #1064–#1068 were all recorded as `self_review_pass`.
 *
 * Updating only this file when adding new labels reflects changes in both emitter / verifier — preventing mismatch regressions.

/**
 * Tool-agnostic marker — names the *act* (an independent adversarial review), not a tool.
 *
 * Why: every other marker is a tool name, so a review run by any other agent could not be recorded.
 * If a session runs an adversarial review through a general-purpose subagent, `adversarial-review`
 * satisfies the proof requirement. Accepted for both labels (the ledger counts them identically);
 * the verification bar is unchanged — a `pass`/`warn` gate in `name`/`command`.

/**
 * Per-label PROOF evidence markers — to claim a label, `name` or `command` in one of `gates[]`
 * must contain at least one of the markers below (case-insensitive; spaces/underscores read as `-`).
 *
 * Why: Adding labels without requiring evidence creates an additional escape hatch. Since declaring
 *   "reviewed via skill" breaks consecutive skip counts in the ledger, that declaration must be supported
 *   by execution records (isomorphic to internal-rule label inflation prevention).
 *
 * `agent_go` is required symmetrically — requiring evidence only for `skill_review_pass` creates a perverse incentive
 *   to declare a *stronger* label to avoid providing evidence. In practice, this imposes no extra burden:
 *   past `agent_go` PROOFs already recorded gate names as `code-reviewer agent` / `code-reviewer agent (verdict)`.
 *
 * `code-reviewer` ⊃ `code-review` (substring) — agent evidence automatically satisfies skill evidence.
 * Semantically sound (agent is a stronger 2nd review). The reverse does not hold: `code-review --fix` does not contain `code-reviewer`.
 *
 * Unlisted labels (`self_review_pass` / `trivial_skip`) require no evidence — they represent declarations that 2nd review
 *   was not performed, which the ledger aggregates as skips.
 *
 * Naming note: Using `TOKENS` in constant names triggers false positives in `secret-patterns.mjs#Env Secret Assignment`
 *   (`[A-Z0-9_]*TOKEN[A-Z0-9_]*\s*=\s*...`), blocking writes — use `MARKERS`.

/**
 * Review assets **this repo ships** — the only tools operator-facing advice may tell someone to run.
 *
 * Deliberately narrower than `LABEL_EVIDENCE_MARKERS`, because the two answer different questions.
 * Markers answer *what counts as evidence*, and may legitimately name tools the repo does not own: a
 * session that has `/code-review` installed and runs it did perform a secondary review, so the record
 * should count. This list answers *what do we tell the operator to run* — and an answer the repo does
 * not ship is not an answer.
 *
 * Conflating the two cost a ship cycle on 2026-08-26. Every advice site named `/code-review --fix` as a
 * primary path; `code-review@claude-plugins-official` was absent from `enabledPlugins`, so the command
 * did not exist for anyone in that environment. The operator read the marker rejection plus that advice
 * as "both admitted paths are closed" and downgraded #1221 to `self_review_pass` — while
 * `code-standards-aligner` sat in this repo, reachable, and had already earned the label on a two-file
 * change in #1212 and again in #1218. The advice was wrong, not the label rules.
 *
 * This is the same defect #1070 fixed one level down. That PR stopped the ledger from measuring *which
 * tool* instead of *whether review happened*; the `/code-review` reference it left in the prose
 * reintroduced the failure at the advice layer, where nothing checked it.
 *
 * Named `REPO_` and not `LOCAL_` on purpose: `local` already means *worktree-scoped* in this codebase
 * (`harness-layout.json` lifecycles `worktree_local` vs `system_persistent`), and "is it available on
 * this machine" is precisely the question this list refuses to answer. What it asserts is narrower and
 * checkable — this repository ships it.
 *
 * `path` is repo-relative and asserted to exist by `tests/unit/quality-gate-labels.test.mjs`. Advice
 * that names a vanished asset is this bug again, so it fails the suite rather than the next ship.
 *
 * `surfaces` declares which CLIs can run the asset (subset of `REVIEW_SURFACES`). The guards that print
 * this advice are registered for every CLI, so a Claude-only asset (subagents) must not be advertised
 * to a Codex or Antigravity session as if it could run it. Declared rather than detected: guessing the
 * current CLI would be a new way to be wrong, while an accurate annotation is right in every session.
 * An asset without `surfaces` is treated as reachable from every surface.
 *
 * "This repository" is wherever this file is running. Projects may not receive all assets,
 * so `formatReviewRemedy` checks each path against the project it runs in rather than trusting the list.
