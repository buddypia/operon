/**
 * ship-base-branch.mjs — SSOT for "which branch does this project ship onto".
 *
 * Why (internal-rule Proposal-stage obligation):
 *   (a) Threat: only `create-pr/ops.mjs` read `base_branch` from the create-pr config; every other
 *       ship-time component hardcoded `main`. `mark-pre-ship-confirmed` stamped `review_diff_id`
 *       against `main` while `ops.mjs#assertApprovalFreshAfterBaseMerge` compared against the
 *       configured base, so on any project whose base is not `main` the two sides measured
 *       different diffs and every ship reported "Pre-Ship human approval is stale". The only way
 *       past was `--force-quality-gate`, which also disables `assertQualityGateNotNoGo` and
 *       `assertQualityGateFreshAfterBaseMerge` — a false alarm that trains operators to silence two
 *       checks that were never wrong. Reproduced when shipping onto `develop`:
 *       the contributed diff was byte-identical before and after the base
 *       merge, yet the marker carried the `origin/main` id and the ship refused.
 *   (b) Existing gap: no module owned this value, so each caller re-derived it.
 *   (c) Simpler alternatives: passing `baseBranch` through every call site was rejected — it leaves
 *       the defaults in place, so the next new caller reintroduces the same split.
 *
 * Default is `'main'`, matching what `ops.mjs` used before it delegated here, so behaviour on a
 * project without a create-pr config (or with `base_branch: "main"`) is unchanged.
 *
 * Boundary : perspective1-only — but `ops.mjs` is deployed as a standalone utility, and
 * its transitive `.cli/lib` dependencies (this module included) are co-deployed with it.
