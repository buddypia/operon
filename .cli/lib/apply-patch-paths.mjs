/**
 * apply-patch-paths.mjs — Extract target file paths for Codex `apply_patch` (pure lib SSOT)
 *
 * Codex CLI always sends `tool_name: "apply_patch"` during file editing, and the patch body
 * is contained in the `tool_input.command` string (official Codex spec: "Bash and apply_patch use
 * tool_input.command" — https://developers.openai.com/codex/hooks). This lib extracts target file
 * paths from that patch string.
 *
 * Shared by worktree-policy-guard (blocks direct editing on main) and worktree-session-owner-guard
 * (blocks cross-worktree editing). Conforms to internal-rule (no direct imports between hooks,
 * pure lib SSOT) — both hooks import this library.
 *
 * Reference: trip-jarvis `.agents/hooks/lib/worktree-policy-core.mjs#extractApplyPatchFilePaths`
 * (production-verified implementation). Parses `*** Add|Update|Delete File:` / `*** Move to:`
 * lines from apply_patch heredoc + invocation fallback.
 *
 * Boundary: Perspective 1 only — worktree guard hooks are not deployed to scaffolds .
 */
