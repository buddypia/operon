 * worktree-plan-path.mjs — Single SSOT helper for worktree PLAN.md locations

 * prevents git tracking via the `.tmp/` pattern in .gitignore.
 *
 * Branch namespace isolation also naturally resolves conflicts across parallel worktrees.
 *
 * Boundary : Applies to Perspective 1 only. Perspective 2 (CONTEXT.json#execution.worktree.plan_path
 * in scaffold internal feature-pilot) is separate.
