/**
 * worktree-path.mjs — Single SSOT for "which worktree does this target absolute path belong to".
 *
 * Core Design Principle (internal-rule Worktree Target-Context):
 *   Worktree determination in path-classifying hooks is resolved **exclusively from the target absolute path**.
 *   Never relies on trigger session ENV/cwd/CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR (=resolveProjectDir).
 *   The session axis is the wrong axis for per-target evaluation — in multi-session worktrees,
 *   a wt1 session would mis-evaluate wt2 / its own worktree (cross-worktree context misdelivery).
 *
 * This module provides **pure functions only** — 0 file reads, 0 git calls, 0 global state.
 *   → Shared state conflicts structurally impossible even during concurrent multi-session / multi-worktree calls.
 *   → As a non-hook module, importing causes zero standalone stdin pre-consumption side effects.
 *
 * Worktree path conventions (internal-rule "Worktree Operations"): All worktrees reside under
 *   `<repo-root>/.worktrees/<branch>`. GitHub Flow branches use `<type>/<slug>`
 *   2 segments (`feature/foo`) — evaluated as 2 segments only when first segment is in KNOWN_BRANCH_PREFIXES.
 *   Escape variants (`hotfix-foo`) and single names (`wt1`) evaluate as 1 segment.
 */

/**
 * Splits an absolute path into the repo root that owns `.worktrees/` and the worktree root itself.
 *
 * Sole place in this module where the `.worktrees/` literal is interpreted — the two exported
 * resolvers and `resolveMainRepoRoot` share one parse so a convention change lands once
 * (internal-rule SSOT singularity).
 *
 * - lastIndexOf — prioritizes innermost (actual file owner) during nested `.worktrees/`.
 * - **2-segment (`<prefix>/<slug>`) evaluation occurs only when first segment exactly matches KNOWN_BRANCH_PREFIXES**.
 *   Prevents misidentifying sub-files of single-segment worktrees (`hotfix-foo` / `wt1`) as 2-segment,
 *   avoiding false-denials of edits within their own worktrees (DEBT-182).
