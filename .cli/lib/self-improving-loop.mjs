/**
 * self-improving-loop.mjs — Single SSOT for evaluating two failure modes of self-improving loops degrading their own standards
 *
 * Fundamental problem: In this repository, the *proposer of improvements* (AI) and the *evaluator of improvements*
 *   (rules, gates, tests) share the same permissions. If the proposer can edit evaluation files, whether score increases
 *   stem from improvements or lowered standards cannot be distinguished post-hoc. Google Cloud's
 *   "7 rules for self-improving agent loops" (2026-08-11) identifies this as the blind spot of loops —
 *   *"Give it a shallow target and it will optimize your agent into something that scores well and works worse. Then it reports success."*
 *
 *   This is not hypothetical. Three empirical cases in this repository:
 *     - #1140: Tests re-implemented production functions as copies, passing independently of real behavior
 *     - #1141: Full `vi.mock` replacements swallowed real behavior while passing
 *     - #1086: Strings from a CI channel with 0 runs in 78 days were used as passing evidence in 25 places
 *   All three represented "green gates but actually worse", remaining invisible until human audit.
 *
 * This module evaluates both modes (both pure functions — no I/O, test isolated):
 *   - `detectBarMove(diffText)`  — Rule 6 "Never let the proposer move the bar"
 *   - `detectFlakyTests(report)` — Rule 5 "Treat a flaky case as a finding"
 *
 * Design Decision — **Non-blocking (advisory)**: Lowering standards can be legitimate
 *   (cleaning dead tests, correcting invalid thresholds). Because intent cannot be evaluated algorithmically,
 *   only facts are surfaced, leaving decisions to the user (isomorphic to internal-rule User Sovereignty,
 *   internal-rule superset detection).
 *
 * Design Decision — **Input is a single unified diff text**: Querying separate git calls per signal causes N+1 spawns
 *   (`.claude/scripts/AGENTS.md` Convention 5) and fragments evaluation logic across callers.
 *   A single `git diff <base>..HEAD` output extracts all five signals.
 *
 * internal-rule boundary: **boundary-uniform (evaluation) / boundary-divergent (entry points)**.
 *   "Has the proposer lowered their own scoring criteria" carries the identical meaning in Perspective 1
 *   and Perspective 2 (scaffolded projects) — this file is the SSOT for evaluation. Conversely, *when to measure* diverges:
 *   Perspective 1 runs at local ship time (`ops.mjs#shipWorktree`), Perspective 2 runs in CI/PR (scaffolded projects receive Actions).
 *   Because Perspective 2 cannot import `.cli/`, it maintains a copy whose behavioral equivalence is enforced by
 *   `tests/unit/self-improving-loop-ssot.test.mjs` (isomorphic to `trunk-branch.mjs` precedent).
