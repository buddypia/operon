/**
 * hook-anchors.mjs - Hook command matching normalization SSOT (anchor + git global option)
 *
 * PreToolUse Bash hook patterns assume that "the command *looks like* `git push …`".
 * This file centralizes two axes that align that assumption with actual shell commands:
 *   - **anchor**: Matches only immediately following command start (`^`) / chain operator (`;` `&&` `||` `|`) / newline /
 *     command substitution (see CMD_ANCHOR_SRC below)
 *   - **git global option stripping**: `git -C <path> push` → `git push` (stripGitGlobalOptions)
 *
 * Simple word boundaries `\b` match trigger strings inside diagnostic code / quoted strings / heredoc bodies / grep / echo
 * as false positives (PR #493 root cause F1-F5).
 *
 * Consumers (verified 2026-08-09): commit-guard / destructive-git-guard / dev-server-guard / pre-ship-review-guard.
 * The purpose of a single SSOT is to prevent cluster regressions where modifying the anchor of one hook leaves others stale.

/**
 * Environment variable assignments preceding commands (`FOO=1 git push`, `A=1 B=2 git push`) — 0 or more.
 *
 * **Why part of the anchor (empirical 2026-08-09, DEBT-272)**: `VAR=x <cmd>` is everyday POSIX shell syntax,
 * not an evasive technique. Yet adding even one assignment broke both `^` and chain operators, **silencing all anchored patterns** —
 * blocking `git push --no-verify` but passing `GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh …" git push --no-verify`. Beyond push bypasses,
 * 4 hooks were simultaneously pierced across `stash clear` / `reset --hard` / trunk commit / `--amend` / unpaneled ship.
 * Crucially, this is the exact pattern AI naturally adopts when SSH hangs, stripping protection without malicious intent.
 *
 * Value is `[^\s;&|]*` — swallowing chain operators would misinterpret subsequent commands as assignment values.
 * Quoted values (`GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -o x"`) include whitespace and are handled via a dedicated branch.
 *
 * **Intentional exclusion (transparent statement)**: Wrapper commands like `env FOO=1 git …` / `timeout 60 git …` / `nohup`
 * are not covered. They are infinite and do not match observed failure modes. What is closed here is losing protection without evasive intent.

 * routes them: a body a shell reads is a program and comes back for inspection, a body a data tool
 * reads is dropped. Either way it is orthogonal to this anchor.
 *
 * Note: `\\n` JS string literal → resolves to `\n` regex metachar (actual newline) when constructing RegExp.
 * Maintain JS string escape level to preserve newline matching.

/**
 * Command separators, for hooks that must *decide* something about a compound command
 * rather than merely anchor a match inside it.
 *
 * **Why these are separate from the anchor above (empirical 2026-09-06)**: the anchor uses the
 * loose class `[;&|\n]` because over-matching there is harmless — a spurious boundary only *permits*
 * a pattern to match, and the pattern itself still has to match. These two are used to answer
 * yes/no questions, so over-matching becomes a false positive (bare `&` would make `2>&1` a
 * "separator"). Both therefore spell out the operators instead of using a character class.
 *
 * **Why they live here**: this file's stated job is to stop one hook's boundary notion from drifting
 * away from another's. It had failed at exactly that — `pre-ship-review-guard` and
 * `bash-file-integrity-guard` each carried a private separator list and **both omitted the newline**,
 * while the anchor above knew about it. Bash treats a newline as a statement separator identically
 * to `;`, and multi-line commands are the normal shape of an agent tool call, so the omission was
 * not exotic: `sed -i` with any following line escaped the in-place integrity check entirely, and a
 * marker-then-ship call written across two lines was diagnosed as if it had never been chained.
 *
 * **Adoption is partial, stated plainly**: only `pre-ship-review-guard` and
 * `bash-file-integrity-guard` read these. `commit-guard.mjs` and `destructive-git-guard.mjs`
 * (5 sites) still split on their own `[\n;&|]+`. That spelling is *not* buggy — it includes the
 * newline — but it is a third convention, and it splits on a bare `&` where these two do not, so
 * migrating it changes what two security guards inspect. That belongs in its own change with its
 * own regressions, not smuggled into this one.
 *
 * The two sets differ **on purpose** — do not merge them:
 *   - SEQUENTIAL: "does an earlier command's side effect land before the next one runs?"
 *     A pipe does not qualify; it hands over stdout, it does not sequence a file write.
 *   - BOUNDARY: "where does one command end and the next begin?" A pipe does qualify.
 *
 * Known limitation (unchanged by this split, stated rather than hidden): a `;` or `&&` inside a
 * quoted script (`sed 's/a/b/;s/c/d/' f.txt`) is read as a separator. Splitting correctly there
 * needs quote-aware tokenization, not a richer regex.

/**
 * Folds `\<newline>` continuations back into one line, and trims the outer newlines that carry no
 * second command.
 *
 * **Call this before either separator above.** A backslash-continuation is the one place a newline
 * is *not* a separator — it is a single command wrapped for readability — so treating the two
 * alike breaks in both directions: `pre-ship-review-guard` reports a lone `ship \<newline> --title`
 * as chained (and a trailing newline, which most tool-call strings carry, made the hint fire on
 * nearly every denial), while `bash-file-integrity-guard` splits `sed -i … \<newline> file.txt`
 * into two segments and loses the target.
 *
 * **Only an odd-length run of backslashes continues the line.** `\\` is an escaped backslash, so
 * `echo a\\<newline>git reset --hard` is two commands to the shell; folding it produced one, and a
 * caller asking "is this chained?" was told no. The parity rule is POSIX, not a heuristic: each
 * pair is one literal backslash, and only a leftover single one can escape the newline.
 *
 * **The pair is removed, not replaced by a space, and the next line's indentation survives.** This
 * looks cosmetic and is not: `--branch=ma\<newline>in` is `--branch=main` to the shell, and folding
 * to `--branch=ma in` made a branch-checking guard read the branch as `ma` (measured downstream
 * 2026-09-18). Whitespace that was already there stays there, so `git reset \<newline>  --hard`
 * still has its separating space.
 *
 * **Quotes and comments are respected, because bash respects them.** Inside single quotes (and
 * `$'…'`) a backslash is literal, so `\<newline>` there is two characters, not a continuation.
 * Inside a comment it is literal too: `# note \<newline>git reset --hard` is a comment followed by
 * a real `reset --hard`. A regex fold joined that line into the comment and the guards stopped
 * seeing the command (review of f222e205, 2026-09-23), so this is a small scanner, not a regex.
