/**
 * trunk-branch.mjs — Single entry point for trunk (protected) branch evaluation (CLI-neutral leaf util)
 *
 * Root problem: The **single concept** "is this branch trunk?" was implemented inconsistently across 4 hooks,
 * with only two recognizing `master` — `worktree-policy-guard#isProtectedBranch` (policy reference + main/master default)
 * and `trunk-start-warning` (internal Set) handled it, while `commit-guard` (`branch === 'main'`) and
 * `worktree-shipping-guard` (`wt.branch === 'main'`) hardcoded 'main'.
 *
 * Consequently, syncing the `git-worktree-isolation` bundle to **projects whose default branch is master**
 * resulted in file edit blocking (`worktree-policy-guard`) and session warnings (`trunk-start-warning`) working,
 * while **direct trunk commits were silently permitted** (empirical reproduction 2026-08-01:
 * denied on main repo / passed through on master repo). Partial enforcement is more dangerous than total failure,
 * as active guards create a false sense of security.
 *
 * Solution: Consolidates evaluation into this file, unifying configuration under existing SSOT
 * (`protected_branches` in `.claude/config/worktree-policy.json`). No new configuration concepts are introduced —
 * this field was already the extension point used by `worktree-policy-guard`.
 *
 * Opt-in widening (2026-09-23): `enforce_worktree_all_branches: true` in the same policy file makes a
 * non-worktree checkout on *any* branch count as trunk (`requiresWorktree`). The key is read here only.
 *
 * Design Decision — **Static evaluation, no git queries**: Automatic base detection in `worktree-new.mjs`
 * (origin/HEAD → main → master) handles branch divergence (selection), whereas this module evaluates protection status.
 * Merging them would invoke `git symbolic-ref` on every hook call, increasing PreToolUse latency and destabilizing
 * checks in local repos without remotes. Static defaults + policy overrides suffice.
 *
 * internal-rule boundary: **boundary-uniform** — "prevent direct trunk work" carries the identical meaning
 * across worktrees and checkouts. No branching required.
