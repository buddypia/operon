/**
 * pre-ship-steps.mjs — Fixed-order step-by-step verification SSOT before ship approval (pure evaluator)
 *
 * Why:
 *   Replaces the previous approach where AI dumped the full panel at once and solicited a single yes/no.
 *   Enforces deterministic machine validation for the prerequisite steps, isolating human trust to 1 explicit approval.
 *
 * Deterministic guarantees:
 *   - Step order is fixed by the `PRE_SHIP_STEPS` array.
 *   - Answers can ONLY be recorded for the currently pending step.
 *   - Answers are bound to what the human actually reviewed — the diff this branch contributes
 *     (`resolveReviewDiffId`), not the HEAD sha. See that function for why.
 *
 * Boundary : perspective1-only — internal-rule is never_deploy. Not deployed to scaffolds.

/**
 * Identifies *what the human reviewed*: the diff this branch contributes, hashed.
 *
 * **Why not the HEAD sha (observed 2026-08-25 → 2026-08-27)**: `ship-worktree` merges
 * `origin/<base>` into the branch as part of shipping (`ops.mjs#cmdShipWorktree`). That merge moves
 * HEAD, so a HEAD-bound approval was invalidated **by the very command the human had just
 * authorised**, and the human was re-asked. With other sessions landing PRs the same day, one ship
 * consumed four separate human approvals before it completed — the loop is structural, not bad luck:
 * re-verification takes minutes, and any PR landing inside that window restarts it.
 *
 * `<base>...HEAD` survives those merges when the base did not touch what this branch touches. Three-
 * dot diffs are computed against `merge-base(base, HEAD)`, so merging the base only advances the
 * merge-base and the branch's own hunks come out identical. The id *does* change when the branch
 * gains real work, when conflict resolution rewrites the branch's own files, and — because the hash
 * covers the rendered patch, not just its semantics — when the base edits a file this branch also
 * edits closely enough to shift hunk headers or context lines. The last case re-asks the human for a
 * change they arguably already reviewed; that is the conservative direction, and it is why this is
 * "survives an unrelated base merge", not "invariant under any base merge".
 *
 * Ship re-checks this after its own merge (`ops.mjs#assertApprovalFreshAfterBaseMerge`) — recording
 * the id at approval time is not enough on its own, because ship mutates the tree afterwards.
 *
 * This mirrors GitHub's own semantics (approvals survive base updates; "dismiss stale reviews"
 * fires on branch commits) and is stricter than it looks here, because this repo squash-merges:
 * the diff *is* the commit that lands.
 *
 * Machine PROOF keeps its HEAD binding deliberately (`quality-gate-proof` step) — re-running a test
 * suite is cheap and must cover the merged tree. Only the expensive, human-blocking signal is
 * rebound. Two bindings, two costs.
