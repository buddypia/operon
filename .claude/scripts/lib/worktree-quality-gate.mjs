/**
 * worktree-quality-gate.mjs — Pre-Ship Quality Gate PROOF record contract SSOT
 * (Phase 2, internal-rule/9. head_sha/staleness is Phase 3).
 *
 * Why: If the PROOF (command / actual result / finding / verdict) of a Quality Gate verdict (Go/No-Go)
 * exists only in chat, auditability is lost after session termination and No-Go enforcement relies solely
 * on prompt-level discipline. This module provides schema validation and fail-open reading for
 * mailbox `quality-gate.json` (`worktree-plan-path.mjs#resolveWorktreeQualityGatePath`) as a single shared contract.
 *
 * Publishers: `.claude/scripts/record-quality-gate.mjs` (validation + atomic write + head_sha stamp)
 *             `.claude/scripts/mark-pre-ship-confirmed.mjs` (`persistQualityLabel` — missing labels only)
 * Consumers:  `.claude/scripts/mark-pre-ship-confirmed.mjs` (verdict=no_go / rejects stale marker)
 *             `.claude/scripts/create-pr/ops.mjs#assertQualityGateNotNoGo` (re-verification at ship time)
 *             `.claude/scripts/create-pr/ops.mjs#collectShipQualitySnapshot` (ledger label — sole read path)
 *
 * Record format (PROOF — command / actual result / finding / verdict):
 *   {
 *     "branch": "feature/x",            // Stamped by publishing CLI
 *     "recorded_at": "ISO8601",         // Stamped by publishing CLI
 *     "head_sha": "abc123...",          // Stamped by publishing CLI (optional — omitted if git lookup fails)
 *     "verdict": "go" | "no_go",        // Required
 *     "quality_label": "agent_go",      // Optional — populated via marker CLI's --quality if omitted
 *     "gates": [                         // Required, 1+ items
 *       {
 *         "name": "code-review --fix",  // Required — Gate/tool name
 *         "status": "pass|warn|fail|skip", // Required — Matches ship-deck signal enum
 *         "command": "npx vitest run ...", // Optional — Executed command (PROOF command)
 *         "detail": "31 passed",           // Optional — Actual result (PROOF actual result)
 *         "finding": "LOW 1 item fixed"    // Optional — Findings (PROOF finding)
 *       }
 *     ]
 *   }
 *
 * Staleness (Phase 3): `head_sha` is the worktree HEAD sha at record time. If new commits are added
 * after recording, verdict=go no longer verifies the current codebase. `checkQualityGateStaleness()`
 * evaluates this via opt-in-by-presence.
 *
 * Boundary : Perspective 1 only.
 * Regression tests: `tests/unit/worktree-quality-gate.test.mjs`.

// push via the internal-rule strict flaky audit. Waiting longer is the correct response for a read that

 * `code`. Routing this through the `safeGit` / `safeExec` family therefore disables the retry **and**
 * all four refusal call sites — silently, with the whole suite still green, because at the
 * `resolveHeadShaResult` boundary both cases collapse to the same `{sha: null, timedOut: false}`.
 * Measured 2026-08-26: `safeExec('sleep 5', { timeout: 60 })` returns `null`, indistinguishable from
 * an uninitialised directory (`.cli/lib/utils.mjs#safeExec` catches every error).
 *
 * Such a swap was proposed on `fix/li1-silent-noop` for a legitimate reason — this 3s budget is
 * invisible to the shared exec-timeout floor, so the "real git repo" test above retry-passed under
 * load. The retry in `resolveHeadShaResult` absorbs that flake without giving up the discrimination,
 * so the budget stays local and raw. `tests/unit/worktree-quality-gate.test.mjs` pins both halves of
 * this contract; that is the only place the regression is observable.
 *
 * Exported for that pinning only — **not a production call path.** Calling this directly skips the
 * retry and hands back a raw throw, which is precisely the discrimination the callers below exist to
 * perform. Anything that gates on the answer goes through `resolveHeadShaResult`.
